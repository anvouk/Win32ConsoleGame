# Win32 Console Game

Weird experimental side-project about building a 2D game inside the Windows cmd.

Use arrows to move player.

Tested on Windows 10 but should also work on Windows 7 and higher.

## Build Steps

Requirements are:
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher.
- vcpkg with `spdlog` package installed.

1. Load project in Visual Studio.
2. Select a `x64` build configuration (`Debug` or `Release`).
3. Hit the build button.
